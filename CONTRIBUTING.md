## How to contribute to fs-filesysteminfo

* Before you open a ticket or send a pull request, [search](https://github.com/cookch10/node-fs-filesysteminfo/issues) for previous discussions about the same feature or issue. Add to the earlier ticket if you find one.

* Before sending a pull request for a feature, be sure to have [tests](https://github.com/cookch10/node-fs-filesysteminfo/tree/master/test).

* Use the same coding style as the rest of the [codebase](https://github.com/cookch10/node-fs-filesysteminfo/tree/master/src).

* In your pull request, do not add documentation or re-build the ./lib/*.js files. We'll do those things before cutting a new release.
