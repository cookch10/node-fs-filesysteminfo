v1.0.1
  date: 2015-01-27
  changes:
    Summary:  Upgraded devDependencies, updated library to fix failing tests on Linux OS (tested on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS x64) and added more tests, added a new fileSystemPermissions attribute to FileSystemInfo objects composed of a new internal FileSystemPermissions class.  See CHANGELOG for full details.

    1.  Updated the fs-filesysteminfo_test.js test file for node-fs-filesysteminfo to include a teardown step for cleaning out all contents of the tmp directory.
         -  Added a cleanDirectorySync function to clean the contents of the tmp directory.
         -  Added a tearDown method to include a clean step for the tmp directory (which runs after each test completes).

    2.  The reason for the failing test (FileInfo-0.1.0-Sync) on Linux OS (which wasn't failing on Windows due to differences in the Windows / Linux filesystem; e.g. false positives were occurring on Windows OS).
         -  The issue was that in some cases the octal representation of the mode value was being passed, and being converted (to octal) again, which changed the intended mode value.
         -  The issue was occurring in the DirectoryInfo.prototype.Create(), DirectoryInfo.prototype.CreateSync(), FileInfo.prototype.CreateSync(), and FileInfo.prototype.CreateSync().
         -  The solution:  toIntegerFromOctalRepresenation is now called inline with native node filesystem calls, rather than storing the octal value in a variable (which might get inadvertently passed on and mangled downstream).

    3.  Testing on Ubuntu Linux uncovered a new problem which is fixed in this release.  When creating a file with ensure and using a mode of 0444, this ends up creating a parent directory with read only persmission.  Since the directory would be created first, the subsequent file was unable to be created.

    4.  On Linux (at least on Ubuntu), running Node's fs.stat (statSync) on a directory with an octal permission of 0444 returns a file mode of 0.  A guess as to why is that maybe there's a permission issue with Node, preventing it from actually stat-ing the directory in question.  This doesn't appear to be a problem on Windows.  This has been fixed in this release and information regarding permissions is now stored on the fileSystemPermissions attribute.

    5.  Added a line of code to set the process.umask to 0 (zero).  On Windows 7 x64 OS, this seems to already be 0.  This does not always seem to be the case on Ubuntu.  Ensuring that the umask is 0 means that files and directories are created with the expected permissions.

    6.  Updated the README.MD
         -  Fixed the description of DeleteSync() in Methods: FileInfo.
         -  Other additions / improvements.

    7.  Removed node_modules from repo.

    8.  Added grunt as a dev dependency.

    9.  Refactored method names to use lower-camel case to follow general JavaScript style guidelines.

    A note on tests.  This library has been tested on the following systems / configurations:
         -  Windows 7 x64 + NodeJS v0.10.33
         -  Windows 7 x64 + NodeJS v0.10.35
         -  Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS x64 + NodeJS v0.10.33
         -  Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS x64 + NodeJS v0.10.35
         *  Tests have been split out into two groups:  asynchronous, and synchronous and each group has its own setup and tearDown methods.  The latest tests in fs-filesysteminfo_test.js will occasionally fail on Windows 7 x64 when run repeatedly (tests that actually fail vary, and I haven't yet found the underlying issue; moving the asynchronous tests ahead of the synchronous tests seems to have improved this issue); this hasn't been seen on Ubuntu x64.
